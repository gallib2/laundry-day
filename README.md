# laundry-day

###### _By PartyBag Games_

White shirts turned pink… Entire suits ruined… And where the hell did all those missing socks go??

You’d better know how to separate your whites, colors and delicates because **Laundry Day** is coming your way!

In this crazy mobile hit you get to play Washington, the hungry washing machine!

Swipe right or left as you go forward to collect the right kind of laundry and avoid the wrong kind.
Swipe up to jump over obstacles and collect laundry from washing lines.

For each wrong item collected you’ll lose one precious life. But don’t worry! If you’re sharp enough you can collect lives along the way.

Try to get as far as you can, collect as many items as possible and survive this never-ending **Laundry Day**!
